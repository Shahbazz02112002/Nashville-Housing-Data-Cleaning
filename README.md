# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project focused on cleaning and standardizing the Nashville housing dataset using SQL. The primary objective was to enhance data quality and usability by transforming date formats, splitting address fields, and populating missing property data. The project aimed to improve data accuracy and optimize the dataset for efficient querying and reporting.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Data Cleaning and Standardization
- **Standardized Date Format**: Converted sale date formats to a consistent standard, ensuring accurate date representations across the dataset.
  
### 2. Address Data Population
- **Populated Missing Property Address Data**: Identified and filled missing property addresses by cross-referencing entries within the dataset.
- **Address Parsing**: Broke down full addresses into separate fields for easier analysis, creating distinct columns for address and city.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Split Owner Address**: Separated owner addresses into distinct components (address, city, state).
- **Replaced Binary Values**: Converted binary fields (e.g., 'Y' and 'N') to more descriptive text ('Yes' and 'No') for better readability.

### 4. Data Deduplication and Optimization
- **Removed Duplicates**: Identified and deleted duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- **Deleted Unused Columns**: Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, enhancing query performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management**: SQL Server
- **Data Manipulation**: SQL

## Outcomes
- Successfully cleaned and standardized the Nashville housing dataset, improving data accuracy and usability.
- Enhanced reporting efficiency by optimizing the dataset structure, resulting in faster querying and analysis.
- Improved data integrity by removing duplicates and filling missing values, providing a reliable dataset for future analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning and standardization in enhancing the quality of datasets used for analysis. The methodologies applied can serve as a model for future data cleaning projects in various domains, ensuring that data remains accurate and actionable.
